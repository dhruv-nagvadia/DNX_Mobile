We do not store your card, UPI, or bank account details — Razorpay handles that directly and shares with us only the confirmation and amount of a completed payment.\n\nUsage information: how you interact with the app (e.g. searches, screens visited), for improving reliability and features.`,

You can delete your account at any time from Profile → Delete account inside the app. When you do, your personal details (name, email, phone) are anonymized and your account is deactivated immediately. Records of past bookings and orders are retained in an anonymized form, as businesses and accounting records reasonably require, but are no longer linked to your identifying information.`,
